*Steps to extract bacteria codon bias:*

1. Copy all contents of MasterBacteria (BacteriaBias, BacteriaGenes, LocalBlast, and all 3 housekeeping files) into
the same folder as the genbank(full) for desired bacteria genomes.

2. In the command prompt. Type 'cd ' and go into the directory in which you have the bacteria genbank files and the 
contents of MasterBacteria. This can be done easily by clicking on the folder in the file explorer and copying the
directory and pasting it after 'cd'.

3. In the command prompt. Type 'python BacteriaGenes.py [name of database (housekeeping, in this case)]'

4. In the command prompt. Type 'cd [name of bacteria]'

5. In the command prompt. Type 'python LocalBlast.py'

6. In the command prompt. Type 'cd [matched]'

7. In the command prompt. Type 'python BacteriaBias.py' 

8. Rename 'output.txt' to '[bacteria name].txt'

9.
